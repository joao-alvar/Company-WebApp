              <h2>7. Controls for do-not-track features</h2>
              <p>
                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
                applications include a Do-Not-Track feature or setting you can
                activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
                about your online browsing activities monitored and collected.
                No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing
                DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently
                respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
                automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.
                If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow
                in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a
                revised version of this privacy policy.
